# Statistics 

I ran the demo OSP and my own implementation of OSP's Memory module, below are short write ups of the differences between the two.

## The number of pages swapped in and out

My own implementation of OSP's Memory module had less pages Read. But it had a higher # of pages written. 

Demo:
    Number of pages read = 1351
    Number of pages written = 328

My Own:
    Number of pages read = 1063
    Number of pages written = 598

## CPU utilization

My own implementation had a higher CPU utilization than the demo - which probably results from the fact I had higher page writes on average than the Demo.

Demo:
    CPU Utilization: 68.7568%

My Own:
    CPU Utilization: 88.2708%

## Service time per thread (avg turnaround time)

My own implementation had a higher average service time per thread.

Demo:
    Average service time per thread: 21025.494

My Own:
    Average service time per thread: 27141.281

## Normalized service time per thread (avg normalized turnaround time)

My own implementation had a higher average normalized turnaround time.

Demo:
    Average normalized service time per thread: 0.05240652

My Own:
    Average normalized service time per thread: 0.05910696
